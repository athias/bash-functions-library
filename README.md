# bash-functions-library
A collection of bash functions to be sourced by other scripts.  These are intended to be as robust as reasonably possible, while still solving specific problems to avoid repeating code or causing inconsistencies.  They are ideal for creating more complex scripts that will be provided to less experienced adminsitrators to automate specialized processes.
